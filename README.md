# Python-Talkback-for-Visually-Challenged
I made simple talk back for visually challenged peoples
but this program is not efficient . 
program works to slow 
delay between the speech is two high 
I am working on it trying to make the app in the efficient way

if you are trying to use this program
install the package 
pip install pynput
pip install pyttsx3

run above two pip commands in command promnt as adminstrator mode
Then run the program
